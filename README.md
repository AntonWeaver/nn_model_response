# Response app for NN model 

This is response App for developed NN model. The main idea - create a simple app to get some responce from NN model: input text -> text output from the model.

The model used for the project: github.com/AntonWeaver/hazop_mlc (see embeddings.pt file)

The project includes:
- Working with FastAPI & Uvicorn (server staff)
- Back-end to get responce from the model
- Result check via Postman

TG-bot realization is available - decided to separate into a distinct repository (Check https://github.com/AntonWeaver/nn_model_response_tg_bot)
